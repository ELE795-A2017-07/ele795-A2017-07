# This is the BELIOT project
This is an Internet Of Things project.
This project contains an Arduino Nano which is the core microcontroller of module.
The module contains an RF circuit (inAir9B) with LoRaWAN technology. This node sends
data to a Raspberry Pi via RF and the Raspberry Pi posts its data to a Webserver via a Ruby script.
Webserver (Ruby on Rails app) can be reached at beliotv3.herokuapp.com. Data is stored into InfluxDB and can be visualized with Grafana.

This unit monitors:
- soil humidity and temperature
- air humidity and temperature
- Ozone concentration
- Dust concentration
- GPS
- Battery Life

Here is a picture of the Arduino node:

The PCBs and electronics circuits were made using the KiCad software.

A User Manual (in French) is to be found on PDF.
